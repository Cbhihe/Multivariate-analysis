## mva -- Multi Variate Analysis

This repository recoups a number of projects in multivariate analysis. Some of the content can be viewed as a preliminary for Deep Learning applied to the same data set. 

##### Content:
Some of the work presented here is concerned with mere toy examples meant for the student to hone her/his skills. They are mostly those in folders titles Lab1, Lab2, etc.  Other development are more personal and involve a greater amount of coding using R and / or python scripting. 

##### Data-sets:
Some of the public domain data set used to perfom analyses were not uploaded on this repo due to the size limitation imposed by GitHub. In such cases at least a snapshot of the data sets is provided as well as a URL, where it can be downloaded. The downloaded data set may or may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. The responsability for that falls squarely  on the data maintainer. In practice, beginning students of MVA will however benefits from the strategy laid out to deal with the data irrespectively of exactly what the data consists of.
